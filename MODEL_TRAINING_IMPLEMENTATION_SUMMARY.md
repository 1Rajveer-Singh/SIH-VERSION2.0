  - `GET /api/training/jobs` - List user's training jobs
  - `GET /api/training/report/{job_id}` - Generate performance report
  - `POST /api/training/deploy/{job_id}` - Deploy trained model
  - `GET /api/training/deployments` - List model deployments

### 3. Data Models (`backend/app/models/training.py`)
- **Location**: `backend/app/models/training.py`
- **Models Implemented**:
  - `TrainingConfigRequest` - Complete training configuration
  - `TrainingJob` - Job persistence and tracking
  - `TrainingMetrics` - Real-time training metrics
  - `TrainingStatusResponse` - Status API response format
  - `ModelPerformanceReport` - Comprehensive performance analysis
  - `ModelDeploymentRequest` - Model deployment configuration

### 4. Frontend Service Integration (`frontend/src/services/training.ts`)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/services/training.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Type-safe API integration
  - Real-time training monitoring
  - Automatic polling for status updates
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Complete CRUD operations for training jobs

### 5. MongoDB Integration
- **Database**: Fully configured MongoDB Docker container
- **Collections**: 
  - `training_jobs` - Job persistence and history
  - `model_deployments` - Deployed model tracking
- **Features**:
  - Automatic job persistence
  - Metrics storage and retrieval
  - User isolation and security
  - Performance tracking and reporting
